How to modify your logo:
-----
Please be sure to read the README.txt file located at sites/default/themes/atmos/README.txt
to understand all of the configuration options available for the Atmos theme before proceeding.

Work in Adobe Illustrator for best results.  The logo.ai will save your logo in the best size for
the theme.  It is possible to make the logo longer if necessary.  You will need to adjust the 
Artboard size under File -> Document Setup... -> Edit Artboards (in the pop-up window)
-----

1.   Install the NLGRegular AND NLGUltraBold fonts found in this folder.  Without
     these fonts you CANNOT modify the logo!!!
