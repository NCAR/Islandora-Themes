Color Scheme:
-----
The Atmos theme is integrated into the Color module, which allows you to use an
administrative interface to change the general color scheme of your site.  To modify
your color scheme, do the following:

1. Navigate to the Atmos theme settings page locate at admin/appearance/settings/atmos

2. You can select pre-defined color schemes at the top of the page by selecting a different
   scheme in the "Color set" dropdown menu.
   
3. If you need to modify a color scheme further, use one of the pre-defined color schemes as
   a starting point.  Then use the color selector fields and the color picker wheel to
   modify colors to specific parts of the page.  You can modify the following page elements:
   
   - Header Top:  Main header bar where your logo and slogan appear.  Make sure to read the
     "Logo, Site Name & Slogan" section below for even more options.
   
   - Header Bottom:  Sets the background color for the header navigation menu.
     - Neither the "Primary nav menu" nor the "Org Nav menu" can be modified through the 
       color module since these are elements we wish to maintain consistant across sites.
       
   - Title and Slogan: If you are using text for the site name (title) and/or slogan, you can
     set the color here.  Please read "Logo, Site Name & Slogan" section below for even more options.
     
   - Main background:  This changes the background of the page "body" where your content/page text
     displays.  The gray background color to the left, right and below the main page content cannot
     be changed since this is an element we wish to maintain consistant across sites.
     
   - Text color:  Changes the text color of the page "body" where your content/page text
     displays.
     
   - Link color:  Changes the color of links within the page "body" where your content/page text
     displays.
     
   - Light block background:  Changes the background color of the "lightblock" blocks found in the
     side navigation bars and the triptych blocks.  To get this to work properly, the blocks must
     have the CSS class "lightblock" added to them.  The CSS class is added using the "Block class"
     field when editing a block.  Blocks are found at admin/structure/block/list/atmos
     
   - Medium block background:  Changes the background color of the "mediumblock" blocks found in the
     side navigation bars and the triptych blocks.  To get this to work properly, the blocks must
     have the CSS class "lightblock" added to them.  The CSS class is added using the "Block class"
     field when editing a block.  Blocks are found at admin/structure/block/list/atmos
     
   - Dark block background:  Changes the background color of the "darkblock" blocks found in the
     side navigation bars and the triptych blocks.  To get this to work properly, the blocks must
     have the CSS class "darkblock" added to them.  The CSS class is added using the "Block class"
     field when editing a block.  Blocks are found at admin/structure/block/list/atmos
     
   - Block link color:  Sets the link color within the blocks and triptych area.
   
   - Footer background:  Sets the background color for the footer area.  If you do now wish to have
     the footer appear as a block, set the background color to #e3e4e6, the default background color
     for the Atmos scheme, and it will blend in seamlessly with the page.
     
   - Footer text color:  Sets the text color for the footer.
   
   - Foote link color:  Sets the color of links within the footer.

Logo, Site Name & Slogan:
-----
You can opt to not use images for either the logo or site slogan in your theme and instead use text
for the site name and slogan.  This is discouraged since it breaks continuity among NCAR 7 UCAR sites.
If you must use plain text, for these options, you can uncheck the options under the "TOGGLE DISPLAY"
settings below the color picker options:

- If you wish to use plain text for the slogan, uncheck the "Use a background image for the Site Slogan?"
  option
  
- If you do not wish to use a logo, uncheck the "Logo" option.

- To use text for the site name, check the "Site name" option.  The site name is set under
  Configuration -> System -> Site information (admin/config/system/site-information)
  - It is possible to use a logo image AND display the site name at the same time.  Just 
    click on both options

- To use text for the site slogan, check the "Site slogan" option.  The site slogan is set under
  Configuration -> System -> Site information (admin/config/system/site-information)
  - It is not possible to use a text version of the site slogan and the image version of the site
    slogan at the same time, even if you have both of them checked.

-----
Further customization:
-----
It is possible to further customize the look and feel of your site beyond what is available under the 
theme settings.  It is highly recommended that you make any changes via the style.css or custom.css
files located in the sites/default/themes/atmos/css folder.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED that you modify 
the layout.css file since that file handles the general structure of the site's layout.  The firebug 
browser plugin is your friend, use it!  A strong knowledge of CSS is required if you plan to take this 
route in modifying your theme.
